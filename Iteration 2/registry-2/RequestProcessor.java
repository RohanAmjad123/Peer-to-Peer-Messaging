/**
 * Process a connection request from a peer in our system.  The registry that this request processor is 
 * created for could be in 'done' mode: this means we are trying to wrap up and close all processes in the system.
 * When we are in 'done' mode, we want a report from the process we are connected with.  Otherwise,
 * we'll connect with the peer to include this peer in the registry and provide it with a start list of
 * known peers in the system.
 * <p>
 * A request is processed by
 * requesting the team name, the source code produced by the team, the location where the peer will
 * receive and send UDP messages and by sending a 
 * (partial) list of peers in the system.  
 * <p>
 * At the end of the communication, when we are in 'done' mode, we'll ask 
 * for a report on all communication for grading purposes.
 * <p>
 * This version of the Registry will make requests in the following order:
 * 'get team name'<br>
 * 'get location'<br>
 * 'get code'<br>
 * 'receive peers'<br>
 * If we are in done mode, instead of 'receive peers', we'll request 'get report' instead.
 * <p>
 * In both case, the communication is ended with a 'close' request. 
 * <p>
 * It is the best version to test your code since the order of operations is predictable. A peer 
 * should be able to handle these requests in any order however: the version we'll use for testing
 * can send requests in any order and can duplicate requests.  The only guarantee is that the 'close'
 * request will be the last request.
 * <p>
 * Information of all peer processes that connect with this registry will be stored.  The
 * registry should be restarted to clear the peer list on a regular bases.  In future the peer list
 * will be maintained based on aliveness of the peer.
 * <p>
 * The class logs all communication for verification purposes, including any errors in
 * communication.
